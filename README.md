# IUCN_classification
- Data and code supporting a research article submission to the *Predictive Biogeography* special issue of Ecography.
- An anonymized pointer is created at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IUCN_classification-anonymous/README.md for double-blind review.
- Data & scripts to reproduce submitted results are available.
- The trained deep-SDM model is provided as `model.torch`.
- `ALL_species_status.csv` contains the IUCN status predictions made with our method in the five time periods considered: present, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080 and 2081-2100.
- `EXT_species.csv` only contains the first time period where species are predicted to become extinct with our method.
